How do we create String?
       - Literal
       - new Keyword :
       Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in) ---> creates an object of JAVA in the memory
       String str = new String("EU9 rocks");
Java Compiler checks the String Pool. And if there is alreay a string in the pool, Java does not create a new one.
        str1: reference to our String object, refernceName of Object, variableName
        str2: reference to our String object --> Address or pointer to object


    ArrayList, Collections, OOP topics: object equality and content (data) equality not same thing

    * Strings are indexed based
    "Java";
     0123  ---> last index 3
     length() returns 4 for this example
