(Why do we need?) or (How we can?) utilize Git/Github
- collaboration
- keep track of changes
- SHARE *****
- TRACK ****
- Version Control --- To keep history of your project
- BackUp Location --- Push then Clone Project at different computer

--- We will create a new project to practice Git/GitHub
-- At this project: we will review week12 JAVA topics
** Create a new JAVA project at your local computer
		- Name: JavaWeek12Project

	Git : This is local program that you install "git.exe", handles all version control in your local computer
	GitHub: This is on the Internet, you open an account so that you can have remote repo

	-- Your GitHub account must be added to IntelliJ

	Git Terms:
	Repository: Folder/Package, keeps track of changes
	- Local Repo: on your Local Computer
	- Remote Repo: Github

	Commit:
		- The changes you made
		- the author of the commit
		- the comment of the author
		- SHA (Simple Hashing Algorithm)- unique character combinations, identifies the commit


GIT Operations: 1.Add ---> 2.Commit --- > 3. Push

	Working Directory (Local place for the project)	 --- ADD ---> Staging Index

	From Staging ----> Commit ----> Local Repo

	Local Repo ----> Push ------> Remote Repo

	Sharing Project: If it is your first time pushing, you need share project first at the github (Adding a Remote Repo to your project)
	- it means you are creating a file location on the GitHub

	-- To start version control: 2 ways --either use the VCS menu or write "git init" to your terminal

	Click on VCS then Enable Version Control

	Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/Oscar/IdeaProjects/EU9_JavaWeek12Project/.git/  I HAVE CREATED A LOCAL REPO IN MY COMPUTER FOR THIS PROJECT

	Next Step: Create .gitignore file

	When your files are red color: for Git, it means they are NOT tracked (not added to staging index)

	*** Git does not keep track of empty folders/packages: you need to have a file in it
