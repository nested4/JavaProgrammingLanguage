static methods ---> can be called without creating an OBJECT-advantage, belongs to the class

especially at testing we will create UTILITY classes, in these classes our methods will be all static methods

static vs instance:
1. instance method can be called only by the object name
2. static methods CAN NOT reach non-static fields(instance) fields
3. from static method we can not call instance variables HOWEVER, we can call static field from an instance method
