    Constructor Overloading

        Review:
        Constructor: A Special Method


        Class Car(){

        String model;

        Syntax:  Access-Modifier ClassName(String k){
            model= k;
        }

        Syntax:  Access-Modifier ClassName(String model){
                this();
                this.model= model
            }

            use for creating objects;


        this. : to call instance variables, or instance methodu
        this() : used for calling constructor

        Constructor Call:
            1. Constructors cannot be called by its name --> this() need to be used
            2  Only a constructor  can call another constructor
            3 Constructor must be called first, should be on the first step
            4 One constructor can not call more than one constructors
            5 Constructor cannot call it self
