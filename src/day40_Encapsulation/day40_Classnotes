            Access Modifiers:
                public:     Always accesible at any where
                protected:  Always visible within same package. Accesible outside to sub classes only
                default:    Always visible within same package. Not accesible from outside packages
                private :   Visible within same class ONLY


    OOP: Object Oriented
           Encapsulation:   Hiding Data by giving private access modifier
                            use public getter&setter methods to read/write the data
                            TO HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL OF DATA

           getter:      read Only, public instance method
                        has a Return Type
                        Return type is same with the data type of the instance variable
                        Has no parameter

           setter:      Write Only, public instance method
                        return type is void
                        Has parameter
                        Parameter type is same with the data type of the instance variable
