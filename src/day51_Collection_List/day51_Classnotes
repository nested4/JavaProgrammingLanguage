Collections

    Data Structures
        Array
        Collection
        Map

    Array:          size is fixed
                    supports both primitive and non-primitive datatypes
                    supports only one homogeneous elements (one type) in an array

    Collection:     Size is dynamic
                    supports only non-primitives
                    supports different types of objects
                    Collection is an interface

                    List (I)):    Accepts duplicates, preserve put order, has index numbers

                        ArrayList :  internally uses Array,dynamic Array
                                     Accessing the data is fast (get())

                        LinkedList:  uses doubly linked list (previous nodes reference, data, next nodes reference)
                                     adding/removing is sfaster (add(),remove())
                                     requires more memory size

                        Vector:      internally uses array
                                     Thread Safe- Synchronised

                        Stack:       LIFO (Last in First Out)
